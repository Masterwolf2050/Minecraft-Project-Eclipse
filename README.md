Minecraft-Project-Eclipse
=========================

Eclipse project files for the Minecraft project created by Pahimar.

This project contains a set of Eclipse project configuration files that work with my Eclipse workspace for Minecraft mod development.

The goal of this is to have an easy to use set of configuration files that you can check to set up a new Eclipse workspace for making Forge mods for Minecraft.

The current configuration is for Minecraft 1.6.2 development

These files work on the assumption that your eclipse workspace directory is in the same directory as your uncompressed forge directory;

For example, if you had uncompressed the MinecraftForge source to D:\development\forge then you should set up your Eclipse workspace as D:\development\eclipse
